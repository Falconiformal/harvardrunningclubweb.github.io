								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hcrc_full-team.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<div>
									<h1>Overview</h1>
									We’re a group of Harvard affiliates who love to run and have fun together. We have practice five days a week with a variety of running routes and workouts. All paces and distances are welcome, and we love to welcome both new and experienced runners. All practices and races are optional, but we love to see everyone's smiling faces at name circle!
								</div>
								<br>
								<div>
									<h1>Races</h1>
									HCRC races too! We attend NIRCA (intercollegiate club running) cross country races in the fall and track meets in the spring, along with some distance and trail races!
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Fall &mdash; Cross Country</h1>
										In the fall we spend our weekends traveling all over the Northeast admiring the beautiful fall colors and competing in cross country races. We attend club meets at BC, Brown, and UConn and race against club teams from the entire Northeast. We also host our home cross country meet in October!
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Spring &mdash; Track</h1>
										In February we host a giant indoor track meet at the Harvard indoor track. We also attend track meets at MIT, Tufts, and others. In the winter months we focus on not letting the cold get us down.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Distance Races</h1>
										We attend the  <a href="https://www.trailanimals.com/"</a> TARC fall and spring classic</a>, which are distance trail races near Boston with distances ranging from 10K to 50 miles.
									<br>
We also attend a half marathon in the late fall, usually at <a href="https://www.millenniumrunning.com/newburyport">Newburyport MA!</a> 
									<br>
								</div>
								<br>
								<div>
									<h1>Socials</h1>
									Board game nights, team dinners, parties, mixers, ice cream runs, sushi runs — running club is so much more than just running.
								</div>
								<br>
								<div>
									<h1>Fall Retreat</h1>
									Every fall we spend a weekend at a cabin in New Hampshire where we run/hike beautiful New England mountains, cook a giant pasta dinner, and sing Taylor Swift karaoke.
								</div>
								<br>
								<div>
									<h1>Membership</h1>
									HCRC is open to all Harvard affiliates. You <b>do not</b> need to be a member to run with us. Members have their race fees covered, get our super awesome t-shirt, and can rep Harvard with our racing singlets. All you need to become a member is $30 per semester or $50 per year, the ability to find the MAC steps, and the heart of a gazelle. We also offer no-questions-asked financial aid!
								</div>
								<br>
								<div>
									<h1>Questions</h1>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">When is the <span style="color: #e07;">first day</span> of practice?</h1>
										First day of practice for the Fall 2023 semester is Tuesday, September 5th at 4:45pm at the Malkin Athletic Center steps.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #e07;">Where</span>, <span style="color: #e07;">when</span>, and <span style="color: #e07;">how fast</span> do you run?</h1>
										We run year-round in greater Boston (Charles River, Fresh Pond, Tufts, Downtown, etc). We meet Mondays through Fridays on the Malkin Athletic Center steps at 4:45pm (3:15pm during the winter). All paces are welcome, and there will likely be someone there who is running your pace!
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Does HCRC have a <span style="color: #e07;">schedule</span> for practices?</h1>
										Yes, although it is very loose. Mondays and Wednesdays are generally longer, slower runs. On Tuesday there is an optional track/interval/hills workout, and on Thursday we always go to Fresh Pond (we &hearts; Fresh Pond). We finish off the week with Fun Friday (chaos runs, Strava art, tag by the river, or running to free ice cream)!
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Is there a <span style="color: #e07;">mailing list</span>?</h1>
										Yes! You can join it here: <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/harvard-running-club/subscribe">groups.google.com/group/harvard-running-club/subscribe</a> (press “Ask to join group”). If you don't have a Harvard email, please introduce yourself.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Does HCRC have <span style="color: #e07;">social media</span> page?</h1>
										We're run-fluencers! Check out our instagram @hcrcinsta or <a title="HCRC Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/Harvard-College-Running-Club-490706610975254/?fref=ts">our Facebook page</a>, and throw us a like!
									<br>
									<br>
									<h1 style="font-size: 16px;">Why are there no <span style="color: #e07;">jokes</span> on this page?</h1>
										Look at the url of this page. Ha! Madest thou look! So endeth the trick.
